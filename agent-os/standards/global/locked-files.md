# Locked Files

Some files require approval before modification. Check before editing.

## Currently Locked

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `product-plan/design-system/DESIGN-TOKENS.md` | Brand colors, fonts, button semantics are finalized |

## What "Locked" Means

- **Do not modify** without asking the product owner first
- If a task requires changing a locked file, pause and confirm
- Read the file for reference—that's always OK

## Why Lock Files

Prevents accidental drift in core design decisions. Changing colors or fonts can break the app's visual consistency.
