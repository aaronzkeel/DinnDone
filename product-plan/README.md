# Fed Up Feeder — Design Assets

This folder contains the Design-OS output for Fed Up Feeder.

## What's Included

**Specifications:**
- `product-overview.md` — Product summary and requirements (SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH)
- `instructions/incremental/` — Milestone-by-milestone build guides

**Design Assets:**
- `design-system/` — Colors, fonts, design tokens
- `data-model/` — Core entities and TypeScript types
- `shell/` — Application shell components (header, nav, layout)
- `sections/` — All section components, types, sample data, and test instructions

## How to Use This

This project uses **Autocoder** for implementation. See `prompts/` in the project root for:
- `initializer_prompt.md` — Creates features, sets up project
- `coding_prompt.md` — Implements features one-by-one
- `testing_prompt.md` — Regression tests passing features

**For implementation details:** See `docs/design-os-to-autocoder-guide.md`

## Sections

| Section | Folder | Key Components |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| Grocery List | `sections/grocery-list/` | GroceryList, GroceryListItem |

| Weekly Planning | `sections/weekly-planning/` | WeekPlanView, DayCard, SwapModal |
| Notifications | `sections/notifications/` | NotificationsList, NotificationCard, CrisisMuteBanner |

## Test-Driven Development

Each section includes a `tests.md` file with test-writing instructions:

1. Read `sections/[section-id]/tests.md` before implementing
2. Write failing tests based on the instructions
3. Implement the feature to make tests pass
4. Refactor while keeping tests green
