# Dinner Bell - Claude Progress Notes

## Session: 2025-01-18 - Feature #15 Dark Mode Toggle

### Completed
- Feature #15: Dark mode toggles correctly ✅

### What was implemented
1. **ThemeProvider** (`src/components/ThemeProvider.tsx`)
   - Uses `useSyncExternalStore` for hydration-safe theme state management
   - Stores theme preference in localStorage (`dinner-bell-theme` key)
   - Supports three modes: light, dark, system
   - Listens for system preference changes when in "system" mode
   - Updates document class (`light`/`dark`) to trigger CSS variables

2. **DarkModeToggle** (`src/components/DarkModeToggle.tsx`)
   - Cycles through: light → dark → system → light
   - Shows appropriate icon: sun (light), moon (dark), monitor (system)
   - Displays current mode label on larger screens

3. **CSS Variables** (`src/app/globals.css`)
   - Light mode colors from DESIGN-TOKENS.md (Harvest Hug palette)
   - Dark mode colors triggered by `.dark` class
   - System preference fallback via `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)`
   - All colors: bg, card, text, muted, border, primary, secondary, danger

4. **Layout Updates** (`src/app/layout.tsx`)
   - Switched from Geist fonts to Lora (headings) + Plus Jakarta Sans (body)
   - ThemeProvider wraps the app
   - Added `suppressHydrationWarning` to html element

### Verification
- Light mode: Cream background (#FAF3E6), darker cream cards (#F3E8D6)
- Dark mode: Dark brown background (#17120E), lighter brown cards (#221A14)
- Toggle cycles correctly through all three modes
- Theme persists after page refresh
- No console errors
- Linter passes on src/ files
